Bio-inspired optimization methods offer great possibilities for solving problems in the business environment but, due to their intrinsic complexity and also their particularities when implementing and adapting them to each of the problems, it has not been possible to extend its use outside the scope of conventional research.


Prodef is a tool that allows the definition of combinatorial optimization problems at an abstract level of description and their subsequent resolution using libraries and external frameworks, such as *jMetal* and *MetCo*. This tool acts as an abstraction layer between the problem model and its resolution techniques, in order to facilitate the user, without programming knowledge or bio-inspired optimization methods, the task of modeling and solving combinatorial optimization problems.
